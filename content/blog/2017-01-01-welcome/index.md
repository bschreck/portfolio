Cofounder and Chief Data Scientist at [Feature Labs](https://www.featurelabs.com).

I'm into Zen Buddhism, urban farming, data science & machine learning, pole vaulting, yoga, mobility/health/fitness, music, skiing, and generally making a fool of myself through art.

# Where I'm at

From July to October 2018, I been pursued data science related freelance projects as well as traveling around Asia. I took a 10-day Vipassana course in Myanmar (blog to come soon). One insight I gained was realizing that developing to the utmost my already deep personal relationships and helping my friends & family in whatever capacity they need should be my #1 priority.
So I'm switching gears and looking for a fulfilling, meaningful job that allows me to be near these amazing people. I'm primarily looking for jobs in robotics, but am also interested in cryptocurrency.

# Previous Work: Feature Labs

In 2016, I helped co-found Feature Labs, which enables enterprises to deploy
predictive analytics solutions in a smart, fast, and disciplined way.
Feature Labs develops automation and UI tools so that business executives, subject-matter experts,
data scientists, and
software engineers can focus on solving business problems instead of
computation and academic problems.

# Open Source Contributions

## Featuretools

I'm one of the lead developers of Featuretools, the most popular open-source feature engineering library on Github. I've worked on Featuretools since April 2016; read [here](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/open-sourcing-featuretools/) why in September 2017 we decided to release it publicly.
Featuretools makes it easy to use feature engineering (both manual and automated) in your data science pipelines by abstracting away low-level computations that have become boiler plate in data science/machine learning applications.
We've found it increases productivity by at least an order of magnitude, makes for more repeatable and deployable code, and frees up cognitive load on developers so they can focus on high-level problems.
It uses the Deep Feature Synthesis ([academic paper](https://www.featurelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DSAA_DSM_2015-1.pdf) and [blogpost](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/deep-feature-synthesis/)) algorithm to automatically generate and compute high-level features from granular, time-varying, multitable data.

# Projects

## At Feature Labs
 - [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) - the most popular open-source automated feature engineering framework on Github. Backed by DARPA in the [D3M](https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) program
 - The [AI Project Manager](https://www.featuretools.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AIPM.pdf) - a collaboration with Accenture that used [ML 2.0](http://news.mit.edu/2018/ml-20-machine-learning-many-data-science-0306) techniques that produced an augmentation tool for software project managers to accurately predict whether projects meet their goals.
 - Helping [BBVA predict credit card fraud](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/predicting-credit-card-fraud/) - automated feature engineering and problem-specific optimizations drastically reduce financial implications of fraud.

## On my own

### Lil Neuron

Human-generated rap is so 20th century. Who's to say Lil Neuron can't be
the illest rapper alive without being "alive"?

Lil Neuron is an AI rapper using recurrent neural networks. See [Lil
Neuron Takes His First Breaths]({% post_url
2016-10-10-lil-neuron-takes-his-first-breaths %}) for my first blog
about it, and the [source](https://github.com/bschreck/lil-neuron) on Github.
Please let me know if you want to contribute!




### Personal Food Computer
Everyone should be able to grow their own food. I'm learning how to do this myself, by building a [Personal Food Computer](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/build-a-food-computer/) and attempting to automate as much of the growing process as possible.
My first crop is Purple Bok Choy!


### Ben Schreck Shits Calendar

### Predicting Body and Mental States

Attempting to predict how tired I'll feel, how much energy I'll have,
how sick I'll be, and the locations and times I do things using both passive phone and watch data as well as active
recording of the food I eat both as it enters and exits my body and the way I feel throughout the day.

### Hacking Hackathons
### Learning Musical Style
I wanted to use neural networks to extract the style/genre of a piece of music and then transform other pieces of music to that style. This was heavily inspired by a similar project for artwork (). The architecture consisted of a combination of convolutional networks extracting the sonic character of a short fixed-length sample and recurrent neural networks propagating this representation through time. I implemented much of the network, but stopped short of testing anything. It was too difficult to legally find a large enough body of genre-labeled music (even though they obviously exist at Spotify, Pandora, etc.). This is a project best left for companies with massive music database.\\

# Past Research

## DAI Lab
My research at MIT focused on data science automation, and specifically,
on automatically generated and solving meaningful prediction problems
given arbitrary relational data. This work culminated in my [master's thesis](
/assets/MIT_Meng_BenSchreck.pdf)
as well as a paper in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2016 titled [What would a data scientist ask?
Automatically formulating and solving prediction
problems](http://dai.lids.mit.edu/Trane.pdf).

## Weiss Lab
 I also helped develop an end-to-end data science foundry
for MOOCs that enabled a systematic way of going from raw data to predictive models. This work was published in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2015
([link](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/uploads/Main/DSAA___MOOC_paper_tar.pdf)).

More fun projects include an [implementation](https://github.com/bschreck/near-optimal-online-matrix-prediction) of near-optimal online matrix-completion algorithms (which had previously only existed in math form),
multiplexed robotic scheduling for liquid-handling robots,
[recipe modification](https://github.com/bschreck/robo-chef) using recurrent neural networks, and [scene detection](https://github.com/bschreck/scenic-recursion)
using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
