## Getting Value from Machine Learning Isn’t About Fancier Algorithms — It’s About Making It Easier to Use

Machine learning can drive tangible business value for a wide range of industries — but only if it is actually put to use.

In short, the gap for most companies isn’t that machine learning doesn’t work, but that they struggle to actually use it.
