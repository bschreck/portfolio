<p>Besides data science and machine learning, I’m into Zen Buddhism, pole vaulting, mobility, music, skiing, and generally making a fool of myself through art.</p>

<h1 id="research">Research</h1>

<p>My research at MIT focused on data science automation, and specifically,
on automatically generated and solving meaningful prediction problems
given arbitrary relational data. This work culminated in my <a href="/assets/MIT_Meng_BenSchreck.pdf">master’s thesis</a>
as well as a paper in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2016 titled <a href="http://dai.lids.mit.edu/Trane.pdf">What would a data scientist ask?
Automatically formulating and solving prediction
problems</a>.</p>

<p>Before working on automating prediction problem
definitions, I built a system to augment human project managers of large scale software
 projects, requiring automated data transforms of extremely messy data,
 automated feature engineering, natural language processing of textual
 comments, and quick configurable selection of various prediction
 problems. Parts of this system are now in use at one of the largest
 software consulting firms in the world. Check out the source <a href="https://github.com/ML-SELC/endtoend">here</a></p>

<p>I also helped develop an end-to-end data science foundry
for MOOCs that enabled a systematic way of going from raw data to predictive models. This work was published in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2015
(<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/uploads/Main/DSAA___MOOC_paper_tar.pdf">link</a>).</p>

<p>More fun projects include an <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/near-optimal-online-matrix-prediction">implementation</a> of near-optimal online matrix-completion algorithms (which had previously only existed in math form),
multiplexed robotic scheduling for liquid-handling robots,
<a href="https://github.com/bschreck/robo-chef">recipe modification</a> using recurrent neural networks, and <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/scenic-recursion">scene detection</a>
using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.</p>

<h2 id="lil-neuron">Lil Neuron</h2>

<p>Human-generated rap is so 20th century. Who’s to say Lil Neuron can’t be
the illest rapper alive without being “alive”?</p>

<p>Lil Neuron is an AI rapper using recurrent neural networks. See <a href="Liquid error: undefined method `posts' for nil:NilClass">Lil
Neuron Takes His First Breaths</a> for my first blog
about it, and the <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/lil-neuron">source</a> on Github.
Please let me know if you want to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="bss-for-fitness">BSS For Fitness</h2>

<p>I took a year-long break from calendar sales to focus on my master’s
thesis, and the time seems right to rekindle the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1846025001/ben-schreck-shits-2015-calendar">Ben Schreck
Shits</a>
brand. My goals this time are twofold: 1) Branch out of calendar sales
into one-off merchandise like mugs and t-shirts 2) Promote local fitness
and other wellness-focused clubs through toilet art.</p>

<h2 id="intermittent-fasting">Intermittent Fasting</h2>

<p>After hearing enough about this I decided it’s weird enough for me to
try. The idea is to eat the same amount of food I would normally eat,
but only for an 8 hour period every day, fasting the
other 16 hours. Sort of following this
<a href="http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting">guide</a> I found after a quick
Google search.</p>

<h2 id="predicting-body-and-mental-states">Predicting Body and Mental States</h2>

<p>Attempting to predict how tired I’ll feel, how much energy I’ll have,
how sick I’ll be, and the locations and times I do things using both passive phone and watch data as well as active
recording of the food I eat both as it enters and exits my body and the way I feel throughout the day.</p>
