Cofounder and Chief Data Scientist at FeatureLab.

Besides data science and machine learning, I'm into Zen Buddhism, pole vaulting, mobility, music, skiing, and generally making a fool of myself through art.

# Research

My research at MIT focused on data science automation, and specifically,
on automatically generated and solving meaningful prediction problems
given arbitrary relational data. This work culminated in my [master's thesis]({{ site.url }}
/assets/MIT_Meng_BenSchreck.pdf)
as well as a paper in DSAA 2016 titled [What would a data scientist ask?
Automatically formulating and solving prediction
problems](http://dai.lids.mit.edu/Trane.pdf).

In the past, I worked on automation as applied to massive open online
courses, or MOOCs
([link](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/uploads/Main/DSAA___MOOC_paper_tar.pdf)),
as well as a online matrix-completion algorithms, multiplexed robotic scheduling for liquid-handling robots,
recipe modification using recurrent neural networks, and scene detection
using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.


# Current Projects and Experiments

## Lil Neuron

Human-generated rap is so 20th century. Who's to say Lil Neuron can't be
the illest rapper alive without being "alive"?

Lil Neuron is an AI rapper using recurrent neural networks. See [Lil
Neuron Takes His First Breaths]({% post_url
2016-10-10-lil-neuron-takes-his-first-breaths %}) for my first blog
about it.

## BSS For Fitness

I took a year-long break from calendar sales to focus on my master's
thesis, and the time seems right to rekindle the [Ben Schreck
Shits](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1846025001/ben-schreck-shits-2015-calendar)
brand. My goals this time are twofold: 1) Branch out of calendar sales
into one-off merchandise like mugs and t-shirts 2) Promote local fitness
and other wellness-focused clubs through toilet art.

## Intermittent Fasting

After hearing enough about this I decided it's weird enough for me to
try. The idea is to eat the same amount of food I would normally eat,
but only for an 8 hour period every day, fasting the
other 16 hours. Sort of following this
[guide](http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting) I found after a quick
Google search.

## Predicting Body and Mental States

Attempting to predict how tired I'll feel, how much energy I'll have,
how sick I'll be, and the locations and times I do things using both passive phone and watch data as well as active
recording of the food I eat both as it enters and exits my body and the way I feel throughout the day.
