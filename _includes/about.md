# Current Projects and Experiments

## Lil Neuron

Human-centric rap is so 20th century. Who's to say Lil Neuron can't be
the illest rapper alive without being "alive" in the agreed-upon sense?

Lil Neuron is an AI rapper using recurrent neural networks. See [Lil
Neuron Takes His First Breaths]({% post_url

## BSS For Fitness

I took a year-long break from calendar sales to focus on my master's
thesis, and the time seems right to rekindle the Ben Schreck Shits
brand. My goals this time are twofold: 1) Branch out of calendar sales
into one-off merchandise like mugs and t-shirts 2) Promote local fitness
and other wellness-focused clubs through toilet art.

## Intermittent Fasting

After hearing enough about this I decided it's weird enough for me to
try. The idea is to eat the same amount of food I would normally eat,
but only for an 8 hour period every day, fasting the
other 16 hours. Sort of following this
[guide](http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting) I found after a quick
Google search.
