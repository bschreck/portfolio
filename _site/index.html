<p>I’m into Zen Buddhism, urban farming, data science &amp; machine learning, pole vaulting, mobility/health/fitness, music, skiing, and generally making a fool of myself through art.</p>

<h1 id="work">Work</h1>

<p>Feature Labs is a venture-backed startup enabling enterprises to deploy
predictive analytics solutions in a smart, fast, and disciplined way.
We develop automation and UI tools so that business executives, subject-matter experts,
data scientists, and
software engineers can focus on solving business problems instead of
computation and academic problems.</p>

<h2 id="projects-weve-done-that-we-can-talk-about">Projects we’ve done that we can talk about</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.featuretools.com">Featuretools</a> - the most popular open-source automated feature engineering framework on Github. Backed by DARPA in the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models">D3M</a> program</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.featuretools.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AIPM.pdf">AI Project Manager</a> - a collaboration with Accenture that used <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/ml-20-machine-learning-many-data-science-0306">ML 2.0</a> techniques that produced an augmentation tool for software project managers to accurately predict whether projects meet their goals.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="past-research">Past Research</h1>

<p>My research at MIT focused on data science automation, and specifically,
on automatically generated and solving meaningful prediction problems
given arbitrary relational data. This work culminated in my <a href="/assets/MIT_Meng_BenSchreck.pdf">master’s thesis</a>
as well as a paper in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2016 titled <a href="http://dai.lids.mit.edu/Trane.pdf">What would a data scientist ask?
Automatically formulating and solving prediction
problems</a>.</p>

<p>I also helped develop an end-to-end data science foundry
for MOOCs that enabled a systematic way of going from raw data to predictive models. This work was published in IEEE/ACM DSAA 2015
(<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/groupWebSite/uploads/Main/DSAA___MOOC_paper_tar.pdf">link</a>).</p>

<p>More fun projects include an <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/near-optimal-online-matrix-prediction">implementation</a> of near-optimal online matrix-completion algorithms (which had previously only existed in math form),
multiplexed robotic scheduling for liquid-handling robots,
<a href="https://github.com/bschreck/robo-chef">recipe modification</a> using recurrent neural networks, and <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/scenic-recursion">scene detection</a>
using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.</p>

<h1 id="current-projects-and-experiments">Current Projects and Experiments</h1>

<h2 id="pole-vaulting-ever-higher">Pole vaulting ever higher</h2>

<p>As always, I am trying to jump a little bit higher every day.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-foray-into-urban-farming">My first foray into urban farming</h2>

<p>Everyone should be able to grow their own food. I’m learning how to do this myself, by building a <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/build-a-food-computer/">Personal Food Computer</a> and attempting to automate as much of the growing process as possible.
My first crop is Purple Bok Choy!</p>

<h1 id="past-projects-and-experiments">Past Projects and Experiments</h1>

<p>One day I will actually write descriptions for all of these!</p>

<h2 id="lil-neuron">Lil Neuron</h2>

<p>Human-generated rap is so 20th century. Who’s to say Lil Neuron can’t be
the illest rapper alive without being “alive”?</p>

<p>Lil Neuron is an AI rapper using recurrent neural networks. See <a href="Liquid error: undefined method `posts' for nil:NilClass">Lil
Neuron Takes His First Breaths</a> for my first blog
about it, and the <a href="https://github.com/bschreck/lil-neuron">source</a> on Github.
Please let me know if you want to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="predicting-body-and-mental-states">Predicting Body and Mental States</h2>

<p>Attempting to predict how tired I’ll feel, how much energy I’ll have,
how sick I’ll be, and the locations and times I do things using both passive phone and watch data as well as active
recording of the food I eat both as it enters and exits my body and the way I feel throughout the day.</p>
