I developed a system that translate Trane problems into human-readable sentences, and a UI that allows humans to rank randomly generated problems based on how meaningful they think they are. Pernican uses these rankings as labeled data and generates features from each dataset. Features include statistical information about the dataset, as well as semantic clusters using Word2Vec topic models on the names of columns. It also generates an exhaustive list of possible prediction problems using a subset Trane. This is nontrivial because datasets have different numbers of columns and different numbers of possible prediction problems. Finally, the system uses both implicit low-rank matrix features as well as explicit extracted features to rank each possible prediction problem and return an ordered list. Users can provide feedback and the system will update its internal model. Note: project showed promising early results but needed more data to reach strong conclusions.
